This schema defines the core tables and columns which should be available in any backend
providing primary care data, allowing dataset definitions written using this schema to
run across multiple backends.

The data provided by this schema are minimally transformed. They are very close to the
data provided by the underlying database tables. They are provided for data development
and data curation purposes.

!!! warning
    This schema is still a work-in-progress while the EMIS backend remains under
    development. Projects requiring EMIS data should continue to use the [Cohort

    Registered deaths

    Date and cause of death based on information recorded when deaths are
    certified and registered in England and Wales from February 2019 onwards.
    The data provider is the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
    This table is updated approximately weekly in OpenSAFELY.

    This table includes the underlying cause of death and up to 15 medical conditions mentioned on the death certificate.
    These codes (`cause_of_death_01` to `cause_of_death_15`) are not ordered meaningfully.

    More information about this table can be found in following documents provided by the ONS:

    - [Information collected at death registration](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#information-collected-at-death-registration)
    - [User guide to mortality statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017)
    - [How death registrations are recorded and stored by ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/howdeathregistrationsarerecordedandstoredbyons)

    In the associated database table [ONS_Deaths](https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/#ONS_Deaths),
    a small number of patients have multiple registered deaths.
    This table contains all registered deaths.
    The `ehrql.tables.beta.ons_deaths` table contains the earliest registered death.

    !!! tip
        To return one row per patient from `ehrql.tables.beta.raw.ons_deaths`,
        for example the latest registered death, you can use:

        ```py
        ons_deaths.sort_by(ons_deaths.date).last_for_patient()
        ```
